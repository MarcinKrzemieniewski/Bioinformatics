### This folder is missing a bit of data, becouse it is roughly a 1.5 GB set of Human genome. Thats why there is a second programme with a genome of Fly.

# App
## This app takes a file with a lot of data about Fly or Human genome and prints out:
* 3 genes with the longest genome sequence
* 3 genes with the biggest amount of transcripts
* 3 transcripts with the biggest amount of exons
